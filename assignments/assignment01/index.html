<h1>Assignment 01</h1>

<p> Why did I choose to stay in the Computer Information Systems major? Over the summer, I had been contemplating <br>
taking a lateral shift into Computer Science as my declared major, with it seeming to be more intense coding classes. <br>
This prospect intrigued me because I have been very interested in exploring the more complex and intense sides of the <br>
coding world. All of these facts led me to consider the switch as we came into the 2023 semester.</p>
<p> Upon entering the school year, I began paying very close attention to the kinds of classes that I was taking and <br>
the professors that taught them. One of the specific professors had very extensive knowledge of the Computer Information <br>
Systems major, and from what he described, CIS is very hands on while CS is more theory. Knowing that I would rather <br>
be using my skills in physical application than study, my decision became very clear to me. I decided to stay in Computer <br>
Information Systems in order to maintain a fulfilling career for myself.</p>
